## Repository Info:

Repository Size: 204 MB

Code can be run downloading the zip file and using VSC for the machine learning code and then opening Tableau for the visual analysis and presentation.

Using a data base created of over 300K Olympian athletes, the data was extracted, cleaned using Python and Pandas, transformed into different CSV files, then loaded into Tableau for final analysis and presentation.  Using KNN, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Multi Linear Regression Models, the Random Forest had the highest predictability if an athlete was going to medal or not.
